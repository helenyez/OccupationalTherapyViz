- assigned ProjectID 9999 to Project ID 1
- reassigned Ellen S Cohn projects to Helen S Cohen
- Updated blank USR_FUNDING_DATE_END with the current date

- Data was sliced by the USR_FUNDING_DATE_START 1982 through 2017 by seven years cumulatively
Number of project was proportionally (times 3) increasing from 18 to 54 to 149 to 406 to 755 in 2016
